<h2> Hey there 👋</h2>

🧑‍💻 I'm Hilmi, a passionate Machine Learning Engineer with over 5 years of experience! I specialize in **architecting and productionizing advanced ML models that drive business value**. My expertise encompasses software development, cloud-based machine learning, and cross-functional collaboration to deliver high-impact, scalable solutions.

💼 I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at PropertyGuru Singapore, where I transform ML projects into revenue-generating solutions. A key highlight of my work includes: 

- Led the development of an [Automated Valuation Model](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/knight-frank-malaysia_knightfrank-knightfrankmalaysia-partnersinproperty-activity-7051073263258529792-5Lct): an enterprise-grade B2B product that automates property appraisals for banks and real estate consultants across Malaysia, streamlining their workflows and enhancing decision-making.
- Architected a **Regional Dynamic Pricing System**: This system significantly enhanced operational efficiency, improved pricing accuracy, and [boosted quarterly revenue by $3.75 million (~11% YoY)](https://investors.propertygurugroup.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx). By automating the pricing process, we increased price update frequency from bi-weekly to daily, optimizing market responsiveness.

📊 I posses a solid foundation in both machine learning and software engineering. I’ve contributed to cutting-edge research, publishing 7 papers in top-tier international conferences and journals with the guidance of ACM Distinguished Scientist [Prof David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/). 

🏅 I hold an **AWS Certified Solution Architect** certification, underscoring my capability to productionize ML projects in the cloud. My technical expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) is further demonstrated by my standing as a **Kaggle Competitions Expert**.

🌟 Beyond my professional endeavors, I’m dedicated to continuous learning and personal growth. Whether it’s engaging in tech events or staying active with tennis and golf, I’m always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow!
